      "content": "Root Cause: Pod is experiencing a restart loop due to an issue with the web-app container\nExplanation: The event messages indicate that the pod has been restarting multiple times, with increasing back-off delays. The `CrashLoopBackOff` status and exponential back-off delay suggest that the container is crashing repeatedly. This is further supported by the `OOMKilled` status in another event message, which indicates that the container was terminated due to an out-of-memory condition (exit code 137).\nRecommended Fix: Check the pod's logs for errors and investigate the cause of the container crashes. Consider increasing the container's memory limits or adjusting the resource requests to prevent OOMKilled errors."
