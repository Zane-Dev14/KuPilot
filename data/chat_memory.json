Check the node's resource utilization and ensure that there are sufficient resources allocated to the cluster.\nRecommended Fix: Run `kubectl describe node <node_name>` to check resource utilization, then scale up the node or add more nodes if necessary. Alternatively, use `kubectl get pods -o wide` to identify other pods consuming resources and consider scaling them down or terminating unused pods."

You can do this by editing the pod's configuration file or using `kubectl edit` command. Specifically, look for the `resources` section in the container spec and update the `limits.memory` value.\nRecommended Fix: Run `kubectl edit pod <pod_name>` to open the pod's configuration file in an editor, then update the `limits.memory` value under the `resources` section. For example: `limits:`\n  memory: \"128Mi\"\n"
